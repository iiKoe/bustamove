## Initial Working Version
The grade for the Initial Working Version is a **8.5**.

## Sprint #1
For grading the sprints I will use the rubrics to grade and give feedback about sprint management and code evolution quality. Then I will grade and give feedback to the assignment. These grades will construct the final grade for the sprint using a 20% (sprint management), 40% (code quality) and 40% (assignment) weight system.

### General Feedback
Going the right way. Try to refactor your code whenever possible, but mostly focus on testing and being on top of the static analysis tools. Code review is very good and more of that would be great.
Sprint documents had a few problems and points to improve on:
1. Splitting must be more or less equal. Omar and Jeroen had litreally half of Vito and Antony.
2. Make sure to make small (1-4 hours at the very most) tasks and define elaborately what the tasks concises. 
3. Try to assign fewer people. Responsibilities are generally fine, but just try to stick with 1 person per task as much as possible.
4. Try to define multiple concrete problems in the reflection and explain how you will improve on these.
